## About Me
My name is Bryant Lu, I am a 19 year old undergraduate student at Drexel University. I am an Interactive Digital Media major at the Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts &amp; Design. In my freshman year, I was a Virtual Reality &amp; Immersive Media major before I decided to pursue User Experience Design.

I am originally from Brooklyn, New York and have always had an interest in exploring my creative side, which stems from growing up in a city that is a famous cultural hub for the arts. As a kid, I would visit the city's museum, art galleries, and explore the multitude of cultures in New York's neighborhoods. I like listening to and playing music, drawing, and painting. When it came time to decide on my career path, I knew that I wanted to have a profession that would allow me to create and express my ideas to people while still being practical and useful to others.

This led me to Drexel, where my studies have allowed me to start developing a skillset that will allow me to succeed in the fields of technology and digital media. In addition, through the exploration of virtual and augmented reality and other forms of immersive media from my first major, I have come to appreciate and experience many different types of media. My goal by the time I graduate is to be able to take a concept and make it a reality using the skills at my disposal.

I love to learn new things and strive to excel at any new endeavors I undertake. I enjoy working and collaborating in teams to make sure that the objective we are assigned is completed to the best of our abilities. Overall, my ultimate goal is to become someone who can adapt and think creatively in our world of constantly evolving technology.
