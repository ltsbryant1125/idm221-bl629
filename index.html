        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Bryant Lu, I am a 19 year old undergraduate student at Drexel University. I am an Interactive Digital Media major at the Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts &amp; Design. In my freshman year, I was a Virtual Reality &amp; Immersive Media major before I decided to pursue User Experience Design.
        </p>
        <p>I am originally from Brooklyn, New York and have always had an interest in exploring my creative side, which stems from growing up in a city that is a famous cultural hub for the arts. As a kid, I would visit the city's museum, art galleries, and explore the multitude of cultures in New York's neighborhoods. I like listening to and playing music, drawing, and painting. When it came time to decide on my career path, I knew that I wanted to have a profession that would allow me to create and express my ideas to people while still being practical and useful to others.</p>
